            <h3>TIPS FOR PERFECT JOLLOF</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>"The Bottom pot:"</strong> Don't worry is some rice sticks to the bottom-this crispy layer(called "bottom pot") is considered a delicacy!</li>
                <li><strong>Color is key: </strong>The rice should have a beautiful orange-red color from the tomatoes and spices.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't over stir:</strong> Once you add the rice, minimize stirring to prevent it from becoming mushy. </li>
                <li><strong>Liquid ratio: </strong>Start with less liquid and add more as needed. Different rice types absorb liquid differently.</li>
                <li><strong>Patience: </strong>Let the tomato base cook down properly for the best flavor-this is the secret to great jollof!</li>
